# 👋 Hi, I’m Natasha 😘
 
- 🍃 🌈 🤓

 ### Remote-Friendly **Linux/SRE-leaning DevOps engineer**
 I build systems that are boring on purpose: observable, reproducible, and hard to break.

 Currently traveling the USA ✌️ 🛫

### I use tools as instruments, not identities. 😈

### If a tool needs constant attention, it’s usually compensating for bad design. 😈

### 💞️ - i3WM --> SwayWM
  
### 💞️ I care about:
- Linux internals
- Reliability over novelty
- Clean tooling
- Long-lived systems
- Minimalism with intent

### Most of my work lives at the intersection of:
- Infrastructure & automation
- Containers (OCI, Docker-compatible runtimes, Podman)
- Configuration management
- Developer ergonomics

### Tooling
- **OS:** Fedora (host), Debian / Arch (containers)
- **Containers:** Podman, Docker-compatible workflows, Distrobox
- **Automation:** Ansible, Bash, CI/CD
- **Infra:** Terraform 
- **Editor:** Neovim (minimal, intentional)
- **Shell:** bash / zsh
- **VCS:** git
- **Monitoring concepts:** metrics, logs, tracing (WIP, by design)

### Current focus
- SRE fundamentals (monitoring, failure domains, incident thinking)
- Linux-first workflows (Fedora, Debian, Arch)
- Containers without ceremony (Podman, Distrobox)
- Text-based tooling (Neovim, tmux, git)
 
### Principle
- If it’s not observable, it’s not reliable  
- Simplicity scales better than cleverness  
- Documentation is part of the system  
- “Works on my machine” is a bug  


I prefer tools that disappear once they’re set up.
